As a quick and easy work-around, if good genome annotation is not available for one of the genomes in question, one can use `NCBI Blast+` to find out which genes from genome A have a significant BLAST match in genome B. Note that this method is limited, as it will only identify likely missing genes in the new genome based on sequence, but not on structure, and genes present in the new genome but not in the reference genome will not be found.
